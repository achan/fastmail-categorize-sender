# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for a Fastmail contacts application. The project is currently in its initial setup phase with only basic configuration in place.

## Node.js Version

- **Required Node.js version**: 22 (specified in `.node-version`)
- Use `nvm use` or similar Node version manager to ensure correct version

## Initial Setup

Since this is a new project, common initialization steps may include:

- `npm init` - Initialize package.json
- Install development dependencies (TypeScript, testing framework, linters)
- Set up project structure for a contacts application

## Development Notes

This appears to be a fresh repository setup for building a contacts management system, likely integrating with Fastmail's contact services. When developing:

- Follow Node.js 22 compatibility requirements
- Consider the context of contact management (CRUD operations, data validation, sync capabilities)
- Plan for integration with Fastmail APIs if applicable

## Project Structure

Currently minimal - only contains:
- `.node-version` (specifies Node.js 22)
- `.git/` (version control)

The project structure will need to be established based on the chosen framework and architecture patterns.
